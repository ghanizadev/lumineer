In this section we will cover how to install Lumineer, how to create a simple service, and later see how can we build and run this service.

Let's start by creating our project folder.

## Creating a simple project

### Installing the dependencies

Create a project in an empty folder, here we will call it `say-hello`:

```bash
# Create the project folder
mkdir say-hello

# Move in to the folder
cd say-hello

# Start a project with default values
npm init -y
```

:::info

Lumineer requires Node ^18

:::

After initialising the project, let's install our dependencies:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npm install --save @lumineer/core reflect-metadata
    ```

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev typescript
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @lumineer/core reflect-metadata
    ```

    ```bash
    yarn add -D typescript
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @lumineer/core reflect-metadata
    ```

    ```bash
    pnpm add -D typescript
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configuring Typescript

Create a `tsconfig.json` new file in the project root, and add the following:

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strictPropertyInitialization": false
  },
  "exclude": ["*/.spec.ts", "*/dist/"]
}

```

After saving the file, we are ready to create our first service, the `SayHelloService`.

### Creating the service

Our service will be really simple, we will create a method, called `SayHello` which will receive a `name` and return a greeting `message` containing the name.

We can start by defining our service class, like:

```typescript title="src/services/say-hello/say-hello.service.ts"
import { Service } from "@lumineer/core";

@Service()
export class SayHelloService {}

```

This class would work normally, but it does not make sense to create a service without methods to call. To fix this, lets create our `SayHello` method:


```typescript title="src/services/say-hello/say-hello.service.ts"
import { Service, UnaryCall } from "@lumineer/core";

@Service()
export class SayHelloService {
  @UnaryCall()
  private SayHello() {
    return "Hello world!"
  }
}

```

Here, we are creating an unary call to handle our `SayHello` method. This is because we will have an input and generate a single output. Unary calls are the simplest way to define a RPC, but there are more patterns which we will discuss later.

Following the logic, we will need to define the message format which this RPC expects, the same for the return value. To solve this problem, we can use the `@Message()` decorator and define our message classes:

```typescript title="src/services/say-hello/messages/say-hello-request.message.ts"
import { Message, PropertyType } from "@lumineer/core";

@Message()
export class SayHelloRequest {
  @PropertyType('string')
  name: string;
}

```

```typescript title="src/services/say-hello/messages/say-hello-response.message.ts"
import { Message, PropertyType } from "@lumineer/core";

@Message()
export class SayHelloResponse {
  @PropertyType('string')
  message: string;
}

```

These two messages will be our request and response for our `SayHello` method. There we made use of the `@Message()` decorator to define our message and the `PropertyType()` decorator to define the type of each property inside our messages, in this case, `string`.

Now we can update our method to make use of the messages:

```typescript title="src/services/say-hello/say-hello.service.ts"
import { Service, UnaryCall, Payload } from "@lumineer/core";

import { SayHelloRequest } from "./messages/say-hello-request.message.ts"
import { SayHelloResponse } from "./messages/say-hello-response.message.ts"

@Service()
export class SayHelloService {

  @UnaryCall({ argument: SayHelloRequest, return: SayHelloResponse })
  private SayHello(@Payload() payload: SayHelloRequest): SayHelloResponse {
    return {
      message: `Hello ${payload.name}!`
    }
  }
}
```

After importing the messages, we can define the argument and the return type inside the `@UnaryCall()` decorator. For unary calls, either argument or return values are optional, but for our example, we need some information to process.

The `@Payload()` decorator magically loads the request body into our method, this is used just as type as this moment, the value of the payload argument **is not** an instance of `SayHelloRequest`.

Finally, just like the `payload` argument, the returned value can be a plain object containing the `message` property. We could return a class instance, but in this case, we care only about the schema, so it is safe to use as return type here.

Now we need to configure our server.

### Configuring the server

To do so, let create a `lumineer.config.js` file in the project root, right next to the `package.json` file:

```javascript title="lumineer.config.js"
/** @type {import('@lumineer/core').LumineerConfig}  */
module.exports = {
  packageName: 'app',
  configFolder: './.lumineer'
};
```

This will tell to our application and CLI tools what should be used to create our `protobuf` files among other configurations.

Lastly, we can create our main function to run the application:

```typescript title="src/main.ts"
import 'reflect-metadata';

import { Lumineer, ServerCredentials } from "@lumineer/core"
import { SayHelloService } from './services/say-hello/say-hello.service';

async function main() {
  const server = new Lumineer({
    services: [SayHelloService],
    credentials: ServerCredentials.createInsecure(),
  });

  await server.run('0.0.0.0:50051');
}

main();

```

:::info

This library uses the `reflect-metadata` package, and it should be the first import in your project. In this example, we are adding the import at the top of our `src/main.ts` file, which is our entry file.

:::

### Project structure

The final project structure should look like this:

```bash
say-hello
├── .lumineer
├── src
│   ├── services
│   │   ├── say-hello
│   │   │   ├── firsay-hello.service.ts
│   │   │   └── messages
│   │   │       ├── say-hello-request.message.ts
│   │   │       └── say-hello-response.message.ts
│   └── main.ts
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── lumineer.config.js
└── tsconfig.json
```

This is also our recommended structure, but you have the flexibility to change it. Check the [LumineerConfig API Reference](/docs/api/types/LumineerConfig) for further information.

And done! this is our service, and now you are ready to run the development server and build.

## Running the project

To run the project on your machine, use the development server, it supports hot-reloading:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npx lumineer dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn lumineer dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
    ```bash
    pnpx lumineer dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After this you can access the service via `localhost:50051` using a client like [Postman](#) or [Insomnia](#).

:::info

To use the API client, you will need the `.proto` file containing the service definition. You can find this inside the generated folder `.lumineer` at the project root, the file name should be `{packageName}.proto`, as defined in the `lumineer.config.js` configuration file. In our example, it will be `.lumineer/app.proto`.

:::

:::warning

This should not be used in production! See [Going to production](/docs/guides/deployment/going-to-production)

:::

## Building the project

To build the project, simply run the build command:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npx lumineer build
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn lumineer build
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
    ```bash
    pnpx lumineer build
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a production version of your project by default. If you wish to use development, pass an optional `--dev` flag to this command.

:::info

Although this could be deployed to production, a few measurements should be taken into consideration. Please refer to the [Deployment](/docs/guides/deployment/going-to-production) section before releasing your app.
