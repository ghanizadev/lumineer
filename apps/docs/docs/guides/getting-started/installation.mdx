To get started, Lumineer only requires the core package. Install using your favorite package manager:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
      npm install --save @lumineer/core
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash
      yarn add @lumineer/core
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
    ```bash
      pnpm install @lumineer/core
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Requirements

- Node.js version 18.0 or higher.
- Typescript

## Running the project

To run the project int your machine, use the development server, it supports hot-reloading:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npx lumineer dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn lumineer dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
    ```bash
    pnpx lumineer dev
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After this you can access the service via `localhost:50051` using a rest client like [Postman](#) or [Insomnia](#).

This should not be used in production! See [Going to production](/docs/documentation/deployment/going-to-production)

## Building the project

To build the project, simply run:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">
    ```bash
    npx lumineer build
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn lumineer build
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="PNPM">
    ```bash
    pnpx lumineer build
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will create a production version of your project by default. If you wish to use development, pass an optional `--dev` flag to this command.

Although this could be deployed to production, a few measurements should be taken into consideration. Please refer to the [Deployment](/docs/documentation/deployment/going-to-production) section before releasing your app.
