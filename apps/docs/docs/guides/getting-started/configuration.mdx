Check the [`lumineer.config.js` API Reference](#) for more information.

:::

A file in the project root is used to share the configuration among project, plugins and CLI tools.

A configuration file looks like:

```javascript title="lumineer.config.js"
/** @type {import('@lumineer/core').LumineerConfig}  */
module.exports = {
  packageName: 'app',
  configFolder: './.lumineer'
};
```

The default export can be an `object` as it shows on the example above or a `(async) function` which return the configuration.

The configuration object can include:

| Property | Type | Description | Default |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ----------- | ------- |
| `packageName` | `string` |The name given to your package. It will be used to defined the home path of your services | `app`|
| `configFolder` | `string` | The name of the folder user by CLI, plugins and the application itself to store generated files used in production builds | `.lumineer` |
