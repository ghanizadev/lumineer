## What is *Lumineer*?

Lumineer is a library build on top of the `grpc-js` package aiming to provide a code-first approach to gRPC[^1] services.

## Goals

This project was built intended to make gRPC[^1] simpler and developer-friendly by providing a hard typed API.

Here we use decorators to tag different classes and so generate the `protobuf`[^2] used by gRPC[^1] to define your schema.

Our main goals are:

- Provide an easy-to-read and simple API to create gRPC applications;
- Integrate tools to make the development process faster;
- Use well-know standards in our project structures;
- Use OOP to define our services.

What is not in our plans:

- Provide third-party solutions like database access, authentication libraries, observability tools, etc...
