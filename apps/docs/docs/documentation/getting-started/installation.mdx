title: Installation
---

To get started, Lumineer only requires the core package.

Install using your favorite package manager:

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lumineer/core):

```bash
npm install --save @lumineer/core
```
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/package?name=@lumineer/core):

```bash
yarn add @lumineer/core
```
or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```bash
pnpm install @lumineer/core
```

## Requirements

- Node.js version 18.0 or higher.
- Typescript

## Recommended project structure

This project is not really dependent to any structure, ypu are dell to use what suits better to your needs. However, we can help you with some ideas:

```bash
my-project
├── .lumineer
├── src
│   ├── services
│   │   ├── first-service
│   │   │   ├── service.ts
│   │   │   ├── model.ts
│   │   │   └── dto.ts
│   │   └── second-service
│   │       ├── service.ts
│   │       ├── model.ts
│   │       └── dto.ts
│   └── main.ts
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── tsconfig.json
└── package-lock.json
```

Here we can have one service implementation (and dependencies) per folder.

This is inspired in other libraries and frameworks, but anything prevents you to create your own.

## Running the project

To run the project int your machine, use the development server, it supports hot-reloading:

``` bash
npx lumineer dev
```

After this you can access the service via `localhost:50051` using a rest client like [Postman](#) or [Insomnia](#).

This should not be used in production! See [Going to production](/docs/documentation/deployment/going-to-production.md)

## Building the project

To build the project, simply run:

``` bash
npx lumineer build
```

This will create a production version of your project by default. If you wish to use development, pass an optional `--dev` flag to this command.

Although this could be deployed to production, a few measurements should be taken into consideration. Please refer to the [Deployment](/docs/documentation/deployment) section before releasing your app.

See more about the [Lumineer CLI here](/docs/category/cli).
